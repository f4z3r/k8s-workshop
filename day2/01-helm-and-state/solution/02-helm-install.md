# Tip 2

Search for Redis Helm Charts. You should find several, such as:

- https://bitnami.com/stack/redis/helm
- https://bitnami.com/stack/redis-cluster/helm

> Make sure you install the helm chart in the correct namespace! If you follow the documentation
> found on the webpages, it might install it in another namespace than `helm-and-state`.
